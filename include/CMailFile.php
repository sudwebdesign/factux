<?php
/* notes from Dan Potter:
Sure. I changed a few other things in here too though. One is that I let
you specify what the destination filename is (i.e., what is shows up as in
the attachment). This is useful since in a web submission you often can't
tell what the filename was supposed to be from the submission itself. I
also added my own version of chunk_split because our production version of
PHP doesn't have it. You can change that back or whatever though =).
Finally, I added an extra "\n" before the message text gets added into the
MIME output because otherwise the message text wasn't showing up.
/*
note: someone mentioned a command-line utility called 'mutt' that 
can mail attachments.
*/
/* 
If chunk_split works on your system, change the call to my_chunk_split
to chunk_split 
*/
/* Note: if you don't have base64_encode on your sytem it will not work */
